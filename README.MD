# ComoFaz

Final project for CWI's Crescer. It was a group project in which I mainly handled frontend; but also
helped on the federated authentication feature of our backend application. This is a social network
in which users may view, review and post about DIY tutorials.

The frontend is written in React. The backend is a Java and Spring Boot Rest API. And for the
database we used a company's instance of the Oracle database.
